# Netheopoiesis

Netheopoiesis is our entry to the Slimefun Addon Jam 2022. 
Created by Sefiraat and J3fftw

This addon has three main aims:
- To bring life to the Nether, as per the Addon Jam's theme
- To create the potential for players to be able to play both Vanilla Minecraft and Slimefun solely in the nether, should they choose to
- To make the nether a place suitable to base in, if wanted.

## Purification
The primary mechanic of this addon is the Purification system. When you place/grow etc. certain items from this addon in the nether, they will begin to lift the veil of darkness over the Nether in the surrounding area. This is the 'Purification Value'. As a chunk's purification value increases, you will be rewarded with things that are not normally possible in the Nether e.g. 
- Being able to sleep in a bed!
- Being able to place water and grow new crops. 
- Mob spawns will slowly be replaced with mobs not normally found in the Nether that respect a normal overworld day/light cycle. 

And much more

Purification begins by finding a Purification Seed. This seed will kick-start your journey in the nether as, when placed, it will slowly begin to purify the surrounding blocks from Netherrack into Basic Purified Netherrack. Overtime you will learn how to purify the Netherrack further into more rich soil types, each with an increasing effect on the nearby purification value.

## Seeds
The secondary mechanic is a vast plant growing/breeding system. Starting with 2 purification seeds next to one another (with an air block between them) you can begin to breed cloned seeds and mutate new variants. These new variants each do something unique from dropping materials, being harvestable for additional items, spawning mobs, pulsing beacon/potion effects and more.

As a bonus each seed will also add to the nearby purification value, with more complex-bred seeds providing more.

An in-depth breeding dictionary is available to keep track of discovered breeds and more detailed information about a seed not inititally available in the regular portion of the guide.
